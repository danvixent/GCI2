Inheritance, although aimed at reducing the length and complexity of code 
can at the same time lead to complexity.
For instance encapsulation is affected by inheritance, therefore the subclass 
is reliant on the superclass, if anything changes therein, the subclass might break.
Nonetheless Inheritance enhances readability and extensively shortens code.

Encapsulation is basically object wrapping objects,mostly....enabling Objects that have objects
as properties to be well represented.But what if a method changes in the defintion of the 
property?..and the change isnt reflected in the Object wrapping such property?...The Code Breaks.


Polymorphism allows generalisation of Objects from the same hierachy
e.g A Manager,a Cleaner, A clerk are ALL PERSONS...and that's a good thing.
But type safety comes into play...if i forcefully coerce an upcast or downcast thats illegal
the code might fail at runtime
